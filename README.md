# E-Commerce-Click-Stream-Analysis-
This project analyzes e-commerce clickstream data to understand user behavior and predict purchasing intent. It involves feature engineering, customer segmentation, and building classification models using Python and Scikit-learn. Key insights are visualized through Power BI dashboards to support data-driven marketing and UX decisions.

Project Overview: 
This repository contains the comprehensive analysis of e-commerce clickstream data, aiming to optimize conversion rates, predict churn, segment customers, detect anomalies, and recommend targeted marketing actions.

Objectives:

Analyze user drop-off and conversion through funnel analysis.

Segment customers using RFM and PCA methods.

Predict customer churn with neural network modeling.

Detect anomalies and suspicious user behavior.

Recommend marketing actions based on analysis insights.


Methodologies Used:-

Funnel Analysis: Conversion rate assessment across user journey stages.

RFM Analysis: Customer segmentation based on recency, frequency, and monetary metrics.

PCA and K-Means Clustering: Customer behavior segmentation.

Neural Network Modeling: Churn prediction.

Correlation Analysis: Feature relationship insights.

Anomaly Detection: Identification of abnormal user behaviors.
